About the timeliness of AQS Data
================================

EPA's AQS Datamart API, the service that pyaqsapi retrieves data from, does not
host real time (collected now/today) data. If real time data is needed, please
use the AirNow API and direct all questions toward real time data there.
pyaqsapi does not work with AirNow and cannot retrieve real time data. For more
details see section 7.1 of the About AQS Data page :cite:t:`AboutAQSdata`.
