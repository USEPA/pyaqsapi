About RAQSAPI
=============
pyaqsapi is a port of :cite:t:`Rpackage:RAQSAPI` to the
python 3 programming environment. For anyone that is familiar with RAQSAPI,
the pyaqsapi API will feel familiar to you, most of the functions are similar
and the parameters sent to each functions are the same. pyaqsapi aims to have
feature parity with RAQSAPI and neither project will have features that the
other project does not - other than programming language environment or
language preference there is no benefit to using one package over the other.
