      # Attributes
      # ----------
      # _header (pandas DataFrame): header information returned from the
      #     AQS Datamart API.
      # _request_time (str): the time stamp that the call to the AQS Datamart
      #     API was received.
      # _status (str): the status (associated with the _status_code) returned
      #     from a call to the AQS Datamart API.
      # _status_code (str): the numeric status_code (represented as a string)
      #     that is returned from a call to the AQS Datamart API.
      # _rows (str): the number of rows contained in the _data.

        edate : a python date object which represents that end date of the data

                    FIPS codes.
        countycode : a python character object which represents the 3 digit
                    state FIPS code for the county being requested

        sitenum : a python character object which represents the 4 digit site

                returned.
        edate : a python date object which represents that end date of the data
                selection. Only data on or before this date will be returned.
        stateFIPS : a python character object which represents the 2 digit
                    state FIPS code (with leading zero) for the state being

        returned to the calling function for further processing. The first seven

                    which represents the parameter code of the air
                    pollutant related to the data being requested.
        bdate : a python date object which represents that begin date of the
                data selection. Only data on or after this date will be
                returned.
        edate : a python date object which represents that end date of the data
